* Everyone knows the YOLO series model always can get good performance on detection tasks.
* I want to know does YOLO really learns the feature information or not.

## YOLO series model
* I already prepared and published the technique description on the internet. [[HERE]](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20120310/ironman/6372)
* One-stage methods prioritize inference speed, and models include YOLO, SSD, and RetinaNet.
* You can also refer to this website I wrote for how to train the YOLO model. [[HERE]](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20120310/ironman/6372)
